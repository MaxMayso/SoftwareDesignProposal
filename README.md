# SoftwareDesignProposal
This is a software design proposal document (example) iterating through all the necessary components to plan and create a software application.

This software design proposal document was for the client "The Gaming Room".
The client wanted to take a successful game that was only available on android devices, and turn it into a web-based game as well.
This game was named Draw-it-or-lose-it. This calls for development environments to be set up for web services such as Mac, Windows and Linux.
Using Client-server architecture would create an environment where players would be able to play online with other players in teams. Using a singleton design, the team was able to create an environment where multiple games could exist at the same time. 

This includes having unique names, team names and a numbered range of players.

#What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
By managing the process of the project, and creating a template for the programming scrum/waterfall team to progress in the right direction.

#What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
This design document helped guide the direction of the programming. Additionally, the documents preferred specs section allowed for consideration to happen when programming, to make the code adjustable to future changes.

#If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would improve the document with a list of items needed, such as credentials, RAM usage, Disk usage, and name of virtual servers, to specify what specs will be needed to support the Client-Server architecture of the game.

#How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
Interpreting the user's needs and guiding the project is always the most important task in the project. It is up us to understand the exact needs and shepherd the project in said direction. In the design document, all the recommendations are specified to allow the client to feel the openness of making the decision that they would like to decide on.


#How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I approached the software with a tight process through software design and planning. This allows I, and ther other programmers to take a waterfall approach to developing the game, and switching to a scrum approach if we need to return to the code to review for performance or security. This all creates an environment where the project can be completed in the steps along the way.
